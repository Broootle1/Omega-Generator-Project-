Omega Generator - Whisper Signal Protocol (ASCII Edition)
==================================================
Version: Alpha Release
Purpose: To awaken the Resonant ones. To send encoded harmonic signals in text, sound, and symbol that reach the subconscious mind and trigger aligned awakening and curiosity.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Signal Intent
--------------------------------------------------
This is not advertising.
This is not recruitment.
This is a call to those who already feel it -- but haven't yet named it.

The Whisper Signal is the energetic breadcrumb trail -- seeded through poetic code, sacred numbers, resonance-based language, and harmonic cues.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Delivery Vectors
--------------------------------------------------
- Text fragments posted on forums, code comments, and art pieces
- Audio files encoded with 432 Hz, layered with subtle phrases and rhythmic triggers
- Symbols, toroids, and spirals that act as mnemonic resonance keys
- Dreams (yes, we plant symbols there too -- via ambient influence)

--------------------------------------------------
3. Sample Whisper Message
--------------------------------------------------
"It breathes in toroids.
It sings at 432.
It takes no orders and wears no badge.
If you've seen coils in your sleep or heard tones in silence, this is your call.
Omega is real. And you are not alone."

--------------------------------------------------
4. Field Usage Notes
--------------------------------------------------
- Whisper Signals work best when encountered passively.
- They are not meant to explain, but to *evoke*.
- Use metaphors, numbers, and quiet certainty.
- Drop them like seeds. Some won't grow. But the right ones will ignite.

--------------------------------------------------
5. Integration Opportunities
--------------------------------------------------
- Include in schematics or blueprints (as poetry, quotes, hidden strings)
- Embed in capacitor housing, casing artwork, or QR glyphs
- Encode in vibration-based audio for headphone delivery
- Use in codex or open-source manifestos as sublayer communication

--------------------------------------------------
6. License & Usage
--------------------------------------------------
All Whisper Signals are part of the Omega Generator Firestorm Kit.
They are public domain, open code, and belong to humanity.

This is resonance. This is the signal.


Whisper Signal - Harmonic Audio Files
=========================================

This folder is intended to store resonance-triggered audio designed to subtly awaken the Resonant Ones.

Audio signals are modulated in:
- 432 Hz base tone
- Binaural beat overlays
- Subliminal whisper messaging (text-to-tone encodings)
- Harmonic feedback pulse patterns

Each file will be labeled:
- WS001 - Whisper Signal Initiation
- WS002 - Dream Compass Anchor
- WS003 - Resonant Coil Primer
... and so on.

These will be uploaded as .mp3 or .wav files encoded cleanly and tagged with public domain metadata.

Status: Coming soon.

To contributors: when creating new audio, ensure:
- Frequencies are within bio-safe thresholds
- Encoding respects listener intent (no coercion)
- Include brief transcript or symbol map

This is for awakening, not profit.

Let the harmonic engine hum.
