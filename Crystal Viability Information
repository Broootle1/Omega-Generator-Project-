Omega Generator - Crystal Viability List
==================================================
Version: Field-Safe ASCII Edition
Purpose: Categorized list of natural and synthetic crystals suitable for use in the Omega Generator based on piezoelectric performance, structural integrity, and availability.

--------------------------------------------------
== VIABLE CRYSTALS ==
--------------------------------------------------
These materials have strong piezoelectric response, thermal stability, and can be sourced naturally or synthetically.

- Quartz (SiO2) - Abundant, stable, reliable
- Langasite (La3Ga5SiO14) - High output, excellent stability
- Gallium Orthophosphate (GaPO4) - Superior high-temperature performance
- Tourmaline - Natural piezoelectric crystal with multi-axis responsiveness
- Topaz (Al2SiO4(F,OH)2) - Can be doped for enhanced piezoelectric effect

--------------------------------------------------
== LIMITED USE CRYSTALS ==
--------------------------------------------------
These have piezoelectric potential but come with challenges such as fragility, low output, or environmental sensitivity.

- Rochelle Salt - High piezo output but very fragile and humidity sensitive
- Berlinite (AlPO4) - Structurally similar to quartz, but harder to source
- Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) - High performance but expensive and temperature-sensitive
- Bismuth Titanate - Decent output but difficult to shape and mount

--------------------------------------------------
== NOT RECOMMENDED ==
--------------------------------------------------
These materials are commonly mistaken as usable but are not viable for Omega application due to structure or lack of piezoelectric properties.

- Obsidian - Volcanic glass, amorphous and non-piezoelectric
- Jade - Too dense and non-piezoelectric
- Glass - Unless specially doped, lacks proper lattice
- Plastic - No piezoelectric properties
- Standard metals - Conduct electricity but do not respond to mechanical stress via voltage

--------------------------------------------------
== CONSIDERATIONS ==
--------------------------------------------------
- Purity matters: avoid inclusions and cracks
- Alignment matters: cut and mount crystals along their primary axis
- Doping can help: some crystals improve with ionic substitutions
- Temperature and pressure change performance significantly
