# HOW TO BUILD the Omega Generator
==================================================
Welcome to the Omega Generator Firestorm release. This guide will walk you through what to build, how to build it, and how to stay safe during the process.

This project is modular and tiered. Start with Tier 1 for basic output and understanding. Tier 2 and 3 scale power and complexity.

--------------------------------------------------
== GENERAL BUILD STEPS ==
--------------------------------------------------

1. **Select a Tier**
   - Tier 1: Portable, low-output. Good for testing and teaching.
   - Tier 2: Lab-grade. Modular, scalable, stores energy.
   - Tier 3: Off-grid capable. Includes feedback tuning and magnetic field control.

2. **Gather Materials**
   - Use the parts list in each schematic or assembly guide.
   - Source piezoelectric crystals (Quartz, Langasite, GaPO4).
   - Obtain magnets, wire, casing, actuators, and capacitors.

3. **Build the Coil**
   - Wind copper wire in a flat spiral or helical wrap around the crystal.
   - Secure ends and prep for voltage extraction.

4. **Position Crystal Inside Magnetic Field**
   - Center your crystal inside or adjacent to a toroidal magnet ring.
   - Ensure symmetry and alignment.

5. **Add Impact or Vibration Source**
   - Use a tuning fork, solenoid, or mechanical striker.
   - Match to the resonance frequency (target: 432 Hz).

6. **Connect Outputs**
   - Wire your coil ends to a terminal block, capacitor bank, or small load.
   - Use a multimeter to verify voltage output.

7. **Test and Tune**
   - Strike or pulse the actuator and observe behavior.
   - Tune for consistent harmonic response.

8. **Expand**
   - Add more coils, crystals, or magnetic fields.
   - Move to Tier 2 or 3 as you gain experience.

--------------------------------------------------
== SAFETY ==
--------------------------------------------------
- Always work with discharged capacitors
- Never strike the crystal too hard
- Avoid short circuits
- Do not attempt grid tie-in without proper engineering review
